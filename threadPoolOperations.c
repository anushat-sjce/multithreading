#Thread pool is a design technique to create set of threads to be ready state when a task is submitted.
#this helps in reuse of threads to execute tasks concurrently.
#instead of creating threads for every tasks, thread pool creates and maintains a collection of pre initialised threads.
#any thread is picked from the pool and task is initialised.

# Thread pool - Collection of pre initialised threads that are waiting for tasks to be assigned.
# Worker threads
# Task queue
# Task execution
# Task submission
